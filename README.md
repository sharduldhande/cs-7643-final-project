# CS7643 Deep Learning Final Project
## Vision Models with Clinical Data Integration for Chest X-ray Analysis

### Project Overview
This project investigates the impact of integrating clinical tabular data with vision models (Vision Transformers and CNNs) for chest X-ray analysis. We explore and compare two distinct approaches for combining clinical metadata with image data:

1. **Multimodal Approach**: Modifying the classifier head to accept clinical tabular data alongside image features
2. **Embedded Approach**: Converting clinical tabular data into a 2x2 matrix and embedding it directly into the image

The project utilizes the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, augmented with clinical metadata including patient age, gender, view position, and follow-up information.

### Methodology

#### Model Architectures
We implement and compare several vision models:
- DenseNet (121 and 201 variants)
- Vision Transformer (ViT) configurations:
  - ViT-B/16
  - ViT-B/32
  - ViT-L/16

Each model is tested with both integration approaches:
1. **Multimodal Integration**:
   - Base vision model processes the image
   - Clinical features are concatenated with image features
   - Modified classifier head processes combined features
   
2. **Embedded Integration**:
   - Clinical data is transformed into a 2x2 matrix
   - Matrix is embedded into the original X-ray image
   - Standard vision model processes the augmented image

#### Dataset
The dataset structure includes:
- Chest X-ray images
- Clinical features:
  - Patient Age
  - Patient Gender
  - View Position
  - Follow-up Number
- Multiple disease labels for multi-label classification

## Example Results
Despite only having access to quite weak clinical correlations to the pathologies we were predicting, there was a statistically significant increase in the AUC and F1 scores of the MM model over the standard model on average and in several specicific pathologies. The following summarizes the results of our experiments:
